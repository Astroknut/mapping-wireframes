# Mapping Wireframes

## But Why?

So far, we've mapped out our projects on paper, or in some cases in design software like Sketch - this is great, but the result is far removed from the programatic entity that your app will one day be.

By using Bootstrap (or any other CSS Framework) to rapidly protoype our project, we can get our mockups closer to the code we actually plan to implement - and a head start on our project. It also allows us to find design flaws we might not have noticed on pen and paper.

Today we'll be working with a Bootstrap sample project to rapidly prototype our project, with live code.

## Bootstrap and Components

Bootstrap has a wide variety of pre-built components, for both CSS and JS:

- [CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)
- [Components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
- [JS](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/)

These pre-fab components are great to cherry-pick and place in your project as your rapidly prototype. For example, pull down the sample-project in this repo and take a look:

![sample-project](img/sample-project.png)

The nav bar alone would probably take us an hour to make - but this navbar came directly from Bootstrap's component list:

- Show students various CSS components in the framework of your choice
- Introduce hosting via CDN for fast prototyping
- Identify how to roughly cut/paste examples and build an HTML playground
- Help students build a grid boilerplate (before letting them work on their own)
- Direct students to create basic HTML/CSS prototypes (lorem-ipsum style) of their project 2 wireframes (students work on their own)
