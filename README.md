# Ideas

- Show students various CSS components in the framework of your choice
- Introduce hosting via CDN for fast prototyping
- Identify how to roughly cut/paste examples and build an HTML playground
- Help students build a grid boilerplate (before letting them work on their own)
- Direct students to create basic HTML/CSS prototypes (lorem-ipsum style) of their project 2 wireframes (students work on their own)
